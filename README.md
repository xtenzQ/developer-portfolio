Personal website made with **[Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)**, **[AOS framework](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos)** and Vue.

This website was developed following article **[How to build a static website without frameworks using npm scripts](https://wweb.dev/blog/how-to-create-static-website-npm-scripts/)** by [wweb.dev](https://wweb.dev/).
